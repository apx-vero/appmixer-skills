# Review Connector

Audits an Appmixer component against the design standards bundled in this
skill's `references/` directory. **You (the agent) do the review
directly** — read the files and produce a structured issue list. There is no
sub-agent to spawn. **Do NOT modify any files.**

## Design Reference

The rules to check live in the `references/` directory next to this SKILL.md:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `04-components.md` | Component structure, component.json schema |
| `05-component-config.md` | Config, transforms, modifiers/lambda patterns |
| `06-component-behavior.md` | Behavior file (.js) patterns |
| `07-component-types.md` | Actions, triggers, dynamic components |
| `08-best-practices.md` | Coding standards, naming, error handling |
| `10-trigger-test-method.md` | Trigger `test(context)` rules for Flow Test Mode |

Complete example files (component.json, behaviors, auth.js, lib.js) are in
`references/examples/`. Real-world example connectors (when you want a
reference implementation): https://github.com/appmixer-ai/appmixer-connectors

## Prerequisites

- **Run from the connector workspace** — the current directory (or a parent)
  must contain `src/<vendor>/`; components live at
  `src/<vendor>/<connector>/`. Only when running from elsewhere, point
  `APPMIXER_SKILL_CONNECTORS_DIR` at the workspace root (optional override).

## Input

A full component name, e.g. `appmixer.MSPowerBI.core.CreateDashboard`
(`<vendor>.<connector>.<module>.<Component>` — `appmixer` is only the default
vendor; the first segment names the vendor dir under `src/`).

## Review process

1. **Read the component.** Its `component.json` and behavior `.js`.
2. **Read established patterns.** List the connector's other components and read
   2–3 siblings to learn the connector's conventions (HTTP client, auth, output).
3. **Read the connector's `auth.js`.**
4. **Load the design rules** from the Design Reference files above.
5. **Detect the component type** — Action (Create/Update/Delete/Send/Post), Get,
   List, Find (outputType selector), or Trigger (On/When). Apply type-specific
   rules. Also detect whether the component is a **dynamic source**: grep the
   connector's `component.json` files for `<ComponentName>?outPort` in
   `source.url` references (ignore self-references that only pass
   `generateOutputPortOptions`).
6. **Check against the rules below** and output the issue list. Report real
   issues only — do not flag correct things.

## What to check

### component.json
1. **name** matches `<vendor>.<connector>.<module>.<ComponentName>` (matching the disk path `src/<vendor>/<connector>/<module>/<ComponentName>/`).
2. **label** — human-readable, title-case, no redundant connector prefix.
3. **description** — present, meaningful, not identical to the label.
4. **icon** — present.
5. **auth** — references the connector's auth service.
6. **inPorts** — valid schema; required fields marked `required: true`.
7. **outPorts** — static components have a typed schema with **`type` + `example`
   on every leaf property** (and `title` for the label); List/Find have an
   `outputType` input and a dynamic `source`; correct JSON Schema types; no
   invented fields. Dynamic `source` URLs carry `ignoreAuth=true` and supply all
   of the target's required inputs (`"dummy"` for ones that don't shape the schema).
8. **Dynamic output options quality (`getOutputPortOptions`)** — the generated
   options MUST derive from a single shared schema const where every leaf has
   `type` + `title` (human label, e.g. "Event ID", not the raw field name) +
   `example`; nested objects use proper JSON Schema `properties` (`{type, title}`
   nodes — never `{label, value}` inside `properties`). Raw field names as labels
   or missing types render as bare keys in the designer variable picker. If the
   behavior appends fields to each record (e.g. `index`/`count`), declare them too;
   only declare fields the behavior actually sends.
8. **inspector.inputs** — labels, descriptions, types for all inputs;
   entity-reference inputs have a `source` pointing to a List/Find component.
9. **quota** — present for components that call external APIs.

### Behavior file (.js)
1. **HTTP client** matches the connector's established pattern (consistency is paramount).
2. **Auth** uses the same fields/headers as `auth.js`; no hardcoded credentials.
3. **Error handling** — API errors handled and wrapped with context, not crashing.
4. **Output** — sent on the correct port; no undefined/null output.
5. **Pagination** implemented for List/Find when the API supports it.
6. **outputType** supported for Find components (flat, first, count, …).
7. **tenantId / accountId** passed correctly for multi-tenant connectors.
8. **Dynamic-source caching** — if the component is referenced as a `source.url`
   from any sibling `component.json` (detected in review step 5), its live fetch
   MUST be cached (`context.staticCache` + `context.lock`, TTL
   `context.config.listCacheTTL`) and errors suppressed for source calls, per
   `07-component-types.md` → "Dynamic Source Calls". The cache key must include
   every result-shaping input (token, tenant, params). Uncached source fetch =
   `error` — inspector opens fire concurrent bursts that trip API rate limits
   (429). Self-references used only for `generateOutputPortOptions` (static
   options) are exempt and must not call the API at all.

### Triggers only
1. **`test(context)` present** — triggers should implement `test()` so Flow Test
   Mode works; its absence is a `warning` (rule `trigger.test-missing`).
2. **`test()` quality** (per `10-trigger-test-method.md`): shares the
   request+mapping path with `tick()`/`receive()` (no duplicated URL/auth/query
   logic); read-only upstream; no state writes (`saveState`/`stateSet`/…);
   honors `context.properties` filters; emits exactly ONE item via `sendJson`
   on the correct port; throws (never fabricates synthetic data) when no real
   example exists.

### Cross-cutting
- Naming consistency with sibling components.
- Inspector field labels match outPort schema field names.

## Output format

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `error` | Violates a mandatory rule — must be fixed |
